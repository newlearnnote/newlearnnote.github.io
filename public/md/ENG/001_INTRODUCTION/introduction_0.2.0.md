## 1. Introduction

**NewLearnNote** is a next-generation knowledge management platform that combines AI and collective intelligence. While traditional personal note-taking applications focus primarily on information recording, NewLearnNote emphasizes utilizing and expanding that information.

Modern knowledge workers face significant challenges in efficiently managing fragmented information and learning from others' specialized expertise. NewLearnNote was developed to address these issues of information overload and knowledge sharing gaps.

## 2. Development Philosophy

NewLearnNote is built on the fundamental belief that "knowledge becomes more valuable when shared." Our development team is guided by the following core values:

**Collaborative Growth**: We believe that genuine knowledge expansion occurs when individual learning connects with others' growth. This goes beyond simple information sharing to create a process where users build new insights based on each other's knowledge.

**Active Learning**: Rather than passively accumulating information, we aim to foster an active learning culture where users continuously question and explore through AI interaction.

**Sustainable Knowledge Ecosystem**: Our goal is to build a healthy knowledge ecosystem where user contributions help other users, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits the entire community.

## 3. Key Features
