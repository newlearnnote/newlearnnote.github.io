# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the difference between note connections and simple link connections?

Note connections go beyond simply linking web URLs with markdown links (`[title](url)`) by creating **official 'reference relationships' that the system recognizes and tracks**.

- **Regular Links**: Users must click links to access information. The system treats these as plain text strings with no additional functionality.

- **Note Connections**: When users link other users' public note URLs in their own notes, NewLearnNote automatically detects this action as a **'reference'** and stores it in the database. Using these relationships, the system can **recommend similar articles that reference notes you're currently writing** and provide **enhanced knowledge recommendations through AI integration**.

### Why use the note network when there's more information available through internet browsers?

While internet information is vast, it lacks **reliability and contextual relevance**.

- **Curated Content**: Notes in the network are **carefully organized and verified knowledge that learners, researchers, and knowledge seekers have personally refined before publishing**. This results in significantly higher credibility and depth than raw web information.

- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Unlike keyword-based search engines, the note network analyzes **the content you're currently writing** to suggest the most relevant notes from other users. This eliminates unnecessary search time and maximizes learning efficiency.

### How do you connect notes to each other? Do users need to manually register each reference note?

Note connections are designed to be **effortless for users**.

- **Simple Process**: Users only need to paste other users' **public note web URLs** into their own notes as standard markdown links (`[title](url)`).

- **Automatic Detection**: The NewLearnNote backend automatically detects these URLs, locates the corresponding note's unique ID in the database, and **registers it as a 'reference note'** without any additional user action required.

Through this simple copy-and-paste action, users automatically contribute to the collective intelligence network and gain access to sophisticated recommendation features.
